Reflection:

In general I am rather frustrated. With planning and with things out of my control. Friday evening, my PC encoutered a critial failure and in short I needed to replace the power supply. This took, until sunday afternoon to get it and install it, which robbed A lot of the time I had planned to invest into the assigment. That being said, I need to recognise I didn't take full advantage of the time I had over the Friday, and spent too much time planning. while I couldn't forsee the PC failure, its important to recognise poor planning in my reflection going forward.

In terms of my understanding. I am impressed with myself, in previous projects I wasn't able to reach the stage of displaying the data on the client and managed to do that here with the short amount of time I did have to work on it. There are some errors at the time of the submission in terms of submitting the data and having it show correctly. I also only have it displaying through local host and I'm aware something would need to change had i managed to get the app on render which i believe is the fetch URL. But I didn't get the chance before the deadline to reach that. It is something I will be doing however. 

The whole goal of the App was simply a card database in which users could submit YGO cards into the database and build a card collection. Naturally I was also going to allow "comments" on cards and the like. But I never got around to this due to the aforementioned circumstances. I also can say I don't fully understand how I would of done that using routesand need more revision. 

Overall, I seem to have some rotten luck with circumstances with these assigments and am abit dishearted that I couldn't once again go full force with this and complete a finished working app. This has however increased my understanding of full stack development. I still add points feel like I am simply copying code without understanding how it works in relation to everything else. I also never got around to CSS styling it. Which is something I haven't tested with react fully. 

Notes to develop/revise:
Understanding the relation of fetch requests and revise .map to develop a better understanding. 

Develop further with adding a comments and like feature under each of the posts for the card database. Possible ask for support on this, using dynamic routes [ I believe through the workshops on week7 I have a better understanding of this, but never got the chance before the deadline]

Continue to improve git practices through branch commits etc.
